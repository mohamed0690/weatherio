## Introduction
Welcome to Weatherio, your go-to weather web app for up-to-date weather information! This project was created as a part of the Front-end Development track at #Route Academy, using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Weatherio provides you with automatic location-based weather updates, forecasts for the next two days, and the ability to explore weather conditions in any city. Stay informed about the weather, rain or shine! ☀️⛅️🌧

## Features
### 📍 Automatic Location-based Weather
When you open Weatherio, it automatically fetches and displays real-time weather data for your current location. Just grant access to your location, and Weatherio will do the rest!

### 📅 Forecast for Days Ahead
Get a glimpse into the weather forecasts for the next two days, tailored to your current location. Stay ahead of Mother Nature's plans and plan your activities accordingly!

### 🌍 Explore Any City
Curious about the weather elsewhere? Our intuitive real-time search allows you to discover weather updates for any city by typing its name. The convenience is unbeatable, whether you're traveling or simply curious.

## Behind the Scenes
### 🔗 API Magic
Weatherio harnesses the power of asynchronous programming, using the fetch method with async/await, to seamlessly connect with a reliable weather API. This ensures that you always receive accurate and up-to-date weather information at your fingertips.
